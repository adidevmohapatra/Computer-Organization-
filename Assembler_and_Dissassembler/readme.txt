The assembler.py has lines 49,95,176,178,and 304 where there is an example.asm. If you add your asm chip by 
removing the example.asm, you can get your hack file by running the assembler.py

The disassembler.py has a line 65 where there is an example.hack. If you add your hack chip by 
removing the example.hack, you can get your asm file by running the disassembler.py

Try to run the disaasembler.py multiple times as it takes a couple tries before it fills up the asm file for some reason on my part
